On June 10, 2024, I, Aarish, started a tough but exciting project to copy Netflix's look using HTML and CSS. I didn't just want it to look similar; I wanted to learn how it all works, like how things are organized and styled to make it easy for users.

First, I studied Netflix's layout to understand how it's built. Then, I made a plan and carefully made the HTML structure. I made sure to put each part in the right place, like the menu bar, the moving pictures section, and the bottom part.

After that, I used CSS to make it look like Netflix. I picked the same colors, fonts, and spaces to make it look just right. I also made sure it looked good on different screen sizes, using special tricks like Flexbox and Grid.

It was hard work, but in the end, I made a website that looks a lot like Netflix, all with HTML and CSS. It doesn't do everything Netflix does, but it taught me a lot about making websites look good and work well for users.
